Deepracer ReadMe.txt

Reward Function: So far, we've determined 3 criteria to include in the reward function for deepracer; Angle difference, turning speed, and turning side.
The idea is that each section calculates it's own reinforcement value (*reward/punishment*) based on a specific feature --> then the values farom each 
section are added together makeup the total reinforcement. 

Angle Diff: 

Turning Speed: 

Turning Side:
